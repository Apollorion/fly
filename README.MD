# What is FLY?
Im an engineer and it annoys me that I have to go through a sales portal to get where I need.  

For instance, `datadog.com` takes me to `datadoghq.com`'s main landing page instead of directly to `app.datadoghq.com`.
The same is for `terraform.io` (I want `app.terraform.io/app`) and aws (gimme more console) and so much more!

Many products / sites are this way. I just want to go straight to what I care about and not have to jump through a bunch of links.

Now, with fly, I can just use the fly extension to do `fly tfc` and it will take me to `app.terraform.io/app`!

# Installation

Coming soon! Submitted to chrome app store!  
If you want to install now, download a release, unzip it, and `load unpacked` its contents in chrome://extensions.


# Usage
After installing the extension, in the omnibox via google chrome: `fly {query}`

`fly tfc` taks you to terraform cloud.  
`fly aws` takes you to the aws console.  
`fly aws us-east-1` takes you to the aws console in us-east-1.
etc, etc, etc.

All flights are defined in `background.ts`.

## Logical Flights
Logical flights are, I guess you could call, "smart links".
They arent hardcoded into this repository and use logic to determine where you want to go.  
Some logical flights (`gh` for example) may require some initial configuration (see below).

### Github - `gh`
The `gh` logical flight works 2 ways.
#### Default Org (config required)
If you visit a specific github org often, you can set the org name so that during the flight you only have to specify the repo name.

Say you visit the `Apollorion` github org a lot.

You can run `fly set gh-org Apollorion` and now the extension will assume the `Apollorion` org if an org isnt directly specified.
Flights like `fly gh manifests.io` will now take you to `https://github.com/Apollorion/manifests.io`.
#### Specifying Org
If you specify an org during your flight, it will use that org instead of the default one.

Flights like `fly gh Apollorion manifests.io` will take you to `https://github.com/Apollorion/manifests.io`.

### AWS - `aws`
The `aws` logical flight will take you to the default console home (`https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home`) if your flight is just `fly aws`.  
Alternatively, you can go to a specific region via `fly aws us-east-1`.

# Devving this repo
I'd like to make devving a little less painful somehow, but right now what you need to do is:
1. cd extension
2. yarn install
3. yarn build
4. test things
5. repeat steps 3, 4 infinitely

I know things like nodemon exist, but it doesnt play well with chrome extensions and I havent figured out why quite yet.
You need to `load unpacked` the extension in the `extension/dist` dir after building at least once.


## Logical Flights
Say a users query is `fly gh Apollorion manifests.io`

The example logic above will match `gh`, split `Apollorion manifests.io` into `$1` = `Apollorion` and `$2` = `manifests.io`.  
The logic defined in `extension/flights.ts` for `gh` is `https://github.com/$1/$2` which resolves to `https://github.com/Apollorion/manifests.io`.

If your logical flight doesnt need to be very smart you can simply add the flight name (`gh` in the above example) to the`logicalFlights` const in `extension/background.ts`.  
The extension will "just work" if you expect users to always type the full query in the extension.  
As an example, the `aws` flight automatically builds the correct query without any special logic because it expects the user to type the full query every time.

If you logical flight does need some custom logic, you can build that into `extension/background.ts`. I'd suggest using `gh` as an example.
